This is Tim Zander's Slope Widget for Garmin devices, in the Garmin Connect IQ Store known as Inclinometer.  See:

I have made only three changes:

 - For Instinct devices, the colors changes to work with the monochrome graphics.

 - The widget displays pitch slope (top/bottom) and roll slope (left/right sides) and LEVEL when level.  The change is, now the widget also displays the overall slope (pitch & roll combined) in the center, as well, at all times  (unless level).

 - Made various tweaks to font size, justification, and other details to make the widget more compatible with different devices, screen shapes, and sizes.

 - Compiled the widget only for devices that Tim did not compile the widget for - mostly newer devices since Tim's widget was updated.

 Tim's app & source code was released with an Apache-2.0 license, and this version is released with the same.

 Below, Tim's README:


# slope-widget

This widget shows the angle of an inclined plane. May be used as a level or to calculate slope angle. Also displays a secondary alpha angle indicator of greater than or less than 18 degrees.

Great for skiing or snowboarding in the backcountry or ski touring, mountaineering and alpinism.
